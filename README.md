- 30945305_FIT5149_Ass1.ipynb/pdf: Assignment solutions documented in Markdown, analysis was done using R. 
- test.csv: Testing dataset.
- train.csv: Training dataset.
- Input dataset contains weather information, number of bikes rented per hour and date information. 

**Tasks completed:** 
- Developed models to accurately predict the number of bikes required.
- Described and justified the choice of my models.
- Analysed and interpreted the results.
- Identified a subset of attributed that have a significant impact on the prediction of the bike demands.
- Reported these attributes with statistical evidence
