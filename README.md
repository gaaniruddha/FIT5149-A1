**Tasks completed:** 
- Developed models to accurately predict the number of bikes required.
- Described and justified the choice of my models.
- Analysed and interpreted the results.
- Identified a subset of attributed that have a significant impact on the prediction of the bike demands.
- Reported these attributes with statistical evidence
